The aim of this project is to develop an student attendence system using RFID unique number.
The main functionalities are:
 1. A new student can register his/her ID card into the attendence system.
 2. Use RFID card while entering into the class. Unregistered student can not access into the class.
 3. Three different modes are currently implemented. These are: register mode, unregister mode, attendence mode. Currently mode are selected from the serial     monitor. Later, LCD will be placed instead of serial monitor.

Hardware description:
 1. AVR microcontroller
 2. HD44780 display
 3. RC522 RFID
